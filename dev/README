Designed workflow:

- zef install has a build step
  - see FontFactory for an example

  - create workspace for assembling parts
    - see private calendar for pieces

#===========================
- prepare for locale

    default.ini (default based on system info)
      - customize with a named "client" (client.ini)

- create a calendar object for year YYYY

    my $cal = Calendar.new: 2023;

- each Day is an addressable object:

    my $day = $cal.day($date);

- add a one-off event

    my $event = $day.add-event;
    # add data
    $event...

- add holidays and other non-personal events

    - federal holidays
    - religious events
    - DST
    - Sunrise/Sunset
    - seasons
    - Moon events
    ... all defined in default.ini

      $cal.add-options;
     

- add personal events from a CSV file

    $cal.load-events: $csv-file;
      - customize with a named "client" (client.csv)

- create a printed calendar

    $cal.print; # the whole thing
    $cal.print: $month; # upper and lower page
