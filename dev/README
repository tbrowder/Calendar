Designed workflow:

- create a calendar object for year YYYY

    my $cal = Calendar.new: 2023;

- each Day is an addressable object:

    my $day = $cal.day($date);

- add an event

    my $event = $day.add-event;
    # add data
    $even...

- create a printed calendar

    $cal.print; # the whole thing
    $cal.print: $month; # upper and lower page
