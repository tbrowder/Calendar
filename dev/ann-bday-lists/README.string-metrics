General string handling using "forall-glyphs..." methods
=======================================================

Keep track of the first and last character for the
final bbox and other string characteristics.

If using ligatures (which should be the default),
implement at least the "Lookup Type 4: Ligature Substitution 
Subtable" described in "learning.microsoft.com" (or my
own version).

Note kerning handling in Font::FreeType...Face
