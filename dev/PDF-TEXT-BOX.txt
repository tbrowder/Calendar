Info from PDF::Content::Text::Box

Text boxes are used to implement the PDF::Content print and say
methods. They usually work “behind the scenes”. But can be created as
objects and then passed to print and say:

=begin code
use PDF::Lite;
use PDF::Content;
use PDF::Content::Text::Box;

my PDF::Lite $pdf .= new;

my $font-size = 16;
my $height = 20;
my $text = "Hello.  Ting, ting-ting.";

my PDF::Content::Font::CoreFont $font .= load-font( :family<helvetica>, :weight<bold> );
my PDF::Content::Text::Box $text-box .= new( :$text, :$font, :$font-size, :$height );

say "width:" ~ $text-box.width;
say "height:" ~ $text-box.height;
say "underline-thickness:" ~ $text-box.underline-thickness;
say "underline-position:" ~ $text-box.underline-position;

my $page = $pdf.add-page;

$page.text: {
    .text-position = 10, 20;
    .say: $text-box;
    .text-position = 10, 50;
    .print: $text-box;
}

$pdf.save-as: "test.pdf";
