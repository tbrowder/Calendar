=head1 TEMPORARY DISCLAIMER

B<Calendar> is a Work in Progress (WIP). Please file an issue if there

welcome.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Calendar;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Calendar> Provides class data for producing calendars. It includes a Raku
program to provide a personalized calendar: C<make-cal>.
Note that calendars may be printed in other languages than
English. Through use of the author's public module B<Date::Names>,
the user can select the ISO two-letter language code and enter it in the C<make-cal>
program. Those codes are repeated here for reference:

=head3 Table 1. Language ISO codes (lower-case)

=end table

In order to create a personalized calendar, you must provide
some data:

=item A single name in ASCII text, with no spaces, consisting of only alphanumeric characters
or underscores or hyphens. That name is used to uniquely identify your calendar and its data.

=item A list of anniversaries, birthdays, and other events the user desires (see table below, also
see the accompanying Excel spreadsheet). The sample spreadsheet is also available by
running program C<make-cal> with the C<files> mode..

=item A list of personalized lines for the cover (optional).

=item A list of monthly quotations if the standard set is not wanted. Another
option is to forego monthly options.

=head2 Example event data

The following table is available as an Excel spreadsheet or a printed form. There
are five data fields used to create the calendar, and a sixth field, B<Notes>,
that is for your use as needed.


=begin item
B<Month>

At least the first three letters of its name (not case-sensitive).
=end item

=begin item
B<Day>

The numerical day of the month.
=end item

=begin item
B<Year>

All four digits of the year of a one-time event (if known).
=end item

=begin item
B<Event>

=item A (wedding anniversary)
=item B (birthday
=item O (some other notable event, or you may use a short set of chars to remind you; see 'Baptism' example.

=end item

=begin item
B<Name(s)>

A short set of characters; spaces or separator characters (C<,>, C</>, C<.>, C<&>) 
enable wrapping to fit a day square, otherwise some characters they may be chopped off.
=end item

=begin item
B<Notes>

Not printed on the calendar, but useful for reminders such as: 'Joe was 32 in 2022 so his birth year was 1990'.
=end item

The following table shows examples of each data field:
