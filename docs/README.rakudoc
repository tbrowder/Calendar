=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Calendar> Provides class data for producing calendars. It includes a Raku
program to provide a personalized calendar: C<make-cal>.
Note that calendars may be printed in other languages than
English. Through use of the author's public module B<Date::Names>,
the user can select the ISO two-letter language code and enter it in the C<make-cal>
program. Those codes are repeated here for reference:
