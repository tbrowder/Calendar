NAME

**Calendar** - Provides class data for producing calendars

TEMPORARY DISCLAIMER
====================

**Calendar** is a Work in Progress (WIP). Please file an issue if there are any features you want added. Bug reports (issues) are always welcome.

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Calendar;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Calendar** Provides class data for producing calendars. It includes a Raku program to provide a personalized calendar: `make-cal`.

In order to create a personalized calendar, you must provide some data:

  * A list of anniversaries, birthdays, and other events the user desires (see table below, also see accompanying Excel spreadsheet)

  * A list of personalized lines for the cover (optional).

  * A list of monthly quotations if the standard set is not wanted. Another option is to forego monthly options.

Example event data
------------------

  * A single name in ASCII text, with no spaces, consisting of only alphanumeric characters or underscores or hyphens.

The following table is available as an Excel spreadsheet or a printed form. There are five data fields used to create the calendar, and a sixth field, **Notes**, that is for your use as needed.

  * **Month**

  * **Day**

  * **Year**

  * **Event**

  * **Name(s)**

  * **Notes**

The following table shows examples of each data field:

<table class="pod-table">
<thead><tr>
<th>Month</th> <th>Day</th> <th>Year</th> <th>Event</th> <th>Name</th> <th>Notes</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr> <td>Apr</td> <td>3</td> <td>1985</td> <td>B</td> <td>Sally L.</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sep</td> <td>29</td> <td>2010</td> <td>A</td> <td>Joe &amp; Sue</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jun</td> <td>14</td> <td>2022</td> <td>Baptism</td> <td>Harold D.</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>may</td> <td>9</td> <td>1998</td> <td>A</td> <td>Bill/Peggy</td> <td></td> </tr>
