TEMPORARY DISCLAIMER
====================

**Calendar** is a Work in Progress (WIP). Please file an issue if there are any features you want added. Bug reports (issues) are always welcome.

```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Calendar** Provides class data for producing calendars. It includes a Raku program to provide a personalized calendar: `make-cal`.

In order to create a personalized calendar, you must provide some data:

  * A list of anniversaries, birthdays, and other events the user desires (see table below, also see accompanying Excel spreadsheet)

  * A list of personalized lines for the cover (optional).

  * A list of monthly quotations if the standard set is not wanted. Another option is to forego monthly options.

  * A single name in ASCII text, with no spaces, consisting of only alphanumeric characters or underscores or hyphens.
